// Remove First and Last Character

// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.


function removeChar(str){

return str.slice(1, str.length-1)
}

// The substring() method takes two parameters in general, the first parameter is the starting index and the second parameter is the ending index. And it returns the string between these indeces (the provided indeces are inclusive) and in any case if only one index is provided to the substring() method then, it will be treated as the starting index and the substring starting from the given index to the last index will be returned.
